# Apple XR Concept

This project contains the source for the [Apple XR Concept video](https://youtu.be/aoBBVyiPqEI). 

NOTE: This project was created for the [concept video](https://youtu.be/aoBBVyiPqEI) we made, so most functionality outside of what's shown in the video is non-functional. This project is not a comprehensive tutorial. However, we wanted to share it publicly in the event that Nova users are interested in seeing how we created certain interactions, effects, or animations and find the source code or prefabs useful in that capacity. Happy digging!

## Setup

This sample does not include Nova, which must be imported before the sample can be used. After cloning the repo:

1. Open the project in Unity. The project will have errors due to the missing Nova assets, so when prompted by Unity either open the project in Safe Mode or select `Ignore`.
1. Import the Nova asset into the project via the Package Manager.
    - When selecting the files to import, be sure to deselect the Nova settings (`Nova/Resources/NovaSettings.asset`) as they are already included and configured for the sample.
